Isabelle's Personal Portfolio Website (ID Assignment 1)

# Isabelle's Personal Website

The website I am creating is my personal website, or an online resume for potential employers to get to know me more other than through my resume submitted during a job application.
 
## Design Process
For the colour scheme of my website, I decided to go with a dark mode as it is more easy on the eyes. I used a dark blue colour (#232946) for my overall background and a pastel purple (#b8c1ec) for my side menu bar. Buttons or links against the dark blue background have a pastel pink (#eebbc3) background to provide improved readability.

## Features
For this website, I decided to place the menu bar options on the left of the webpage in desktop mode. The formatting has not been done for tablet or mobile mode yet but they will be adjusted and optimised for 3 device sizes, namely desktop, tablet and mobile. 

In the menu bar, I have included links to Home, About Me, Education, Achievements, Testimonials, Hobbies and a Contact Me page.

In the Home page, it has a greeting and briefly introduce myself in the JavaScript continuous typing script. Users will be able to access the Contact Me form through the home page directly and this feature will be useful to those who have the intention of contacting me directly and have already knew me through other platforms. Additionally, I have links available under the text "Follow me on these platforms" to my Instagram, Facebook, Linkedin and Github accounts which would enable the user to gain a better understanding of who I am from these available platforms.

In the Contact Me page, there is a form for the user to contact me for enquiries.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
In the About Me page, it will have a brief introduction about myself which would enable the user to understand who I am as a person in general before they know me even further through the other pages on my website. This page will also contain the PDF of my resume which I have done up for job applications, which is available for them to download and view as well.

In the Education page, it will contain the schools which I have studied in over the course of my education journey and what I did in each of the schools

In the Achievements page, it will contain certifications or awards I have achieved over the years of my study, academic or otherwise. This will enable the user to see that I am an all-rounded individual.

In the Testimonials page, it will contain images of the testimonials I have recieved from my teachers and principal, which could potentially serve as character witnesses for my personality and character.

In the Hobbies page, it will contain pictures and brief descriptions of the activities I enjoy doing in my free time. This shows the user that I am able to have a study-life balance and not just study or play entirely. 

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
