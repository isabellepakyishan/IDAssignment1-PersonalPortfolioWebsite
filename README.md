Isabelle's Personal Portfolio Website (ID Assignment 1)

# Isabelle's Personal Website

The website I am creating is my personal website, or an online resume for potential employers to get to know me more other than through my resume submitted during a job application.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
## Design Process
 
For the colour scheme of my website, I decided to go with a dark mode as it is more easy on the eyes. I used a dark blue colour (#232946) for my overall background and a pastel purple (#b8c1ec) for my side menu bar. Buttons or links against the dark blue background have a pastel pink (#eebbc3) background to provide improved readability.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
