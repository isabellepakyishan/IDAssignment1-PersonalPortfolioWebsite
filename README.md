Isabelle's Personal Portfolio Website (ID Assignment 1)

# Isabelle's Personal Website

The website I am creating is my personal website, or an online resume for potential employers to get to know me more other than through my resume submitted during a job application. This site is made to lean towards the informal side to let the audience know what I do both academically and non-acdemically.

## Design Process

For the colour scheme of my website, I decided to go with a dark mode as it is more easy on the eyes. I used a dark blue colour (#232946) for my overall background and a pastel purple (#b8c1ec) for my side menu bar. Buttons or links against the dark blue background have a pastel pink (#eebbc3) background to provide improved readability.

### User Story

Employers & Head hunters: This group of people would most likely want to understand the background of their potential employees before hiring them. They may also want to know what are some of the activities their potential employees do outside their free time, mainly to see if they are holistic all-rounders who are not only focussed on academics.

Collaborators: This group of people looking for people to collaborate with them will want to understand if the character and personality of the person matches with that of who they are looking for. This website will help the collaborators gain a basic understanding of the potential person they are looking for.

## Features

For this website, I decided to place the menu bar options on the left of the webpage in desktop mode. As of now, my website is reponsive for desktop and mobile.

In the menu bar, I have included links to Home, About Me, Education, Achievements, Testimonials, Hobbies and a Contact Me page.

In the Home page, it has a greeting and briefly introduce myself in the JavaScript continuous typing script. Users will be able to access the Contact Me form through the home page directly and this feature will be useful to those who have the intention of contacting me directly and have already knew me through other platforms. I have also included the link to a PDF version of my resume for the audience's easy access Additionally, I have links available under the text "Follow me on these platforms" to my Instagram, Facebook, Linkedin and Github accounts which would enable the user to gain a better understanding of who I am from these available platforms.

In the About Me page, the audience is able to understand a little background about myself, such as why I chose to pursue a Diploma in Information Technology and what I intend to pursue in the future. Within there is a link to include a link to my resume again for the audience's easy access.

In the Education page, there is a description of what I did in each of the schools that I have been in. This page enables them to see what I have done and contributed to the schools

In the Achievements page, it contains pictures of my certificates and achievements which are important to me and show my qualification skills

In the Testimonials page, it contains pictures of the testimonials I have received from my past teachers and principal for the audience to get a better understanding of my character and personality

In the Hobbies page, it contains a list of hobbies which I do to show that I am a holistic person overall.

In the Contact Me page, there is a form for the user to contact me for enquiries.

### Features Left to Implement (Implemented)

In the About Me page, it will have a brief introduction about myself which would enable the user to understand who I am as a person in general before they know me even further through the other pages on my website. This page will also contain the PDF of my resume which I have done up for job applications, which is available for them to download and view as well.

In the Education page, it will contain the schools which I have studied in over the course of my education journey and what I did in each of the schools

In the Achievements page, it will contain certifications or awards I have achieved over the years of my study, academic or otherwise. This will enable the user to see that I am an all-rounded individual.

In the Testimonials page, it will contain images of the testimonials I have recieved from my teachers and principal, which could potentially serve as character witnesses for my personality and character.

In the Hobbies page, it will contain pictures and brief descriptions of the activities I enjoy doing in my free time. This shows the user that I am able to have a study-life balance and not just study or play entirely.

## Technologies Used

In this section, I used HTML, CSS and JS.
I also made use of some tutorials online (modified to suit my website)

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
   1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
   2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
   3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
   4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
