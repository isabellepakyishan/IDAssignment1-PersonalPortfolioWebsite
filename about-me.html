    <main class="about-me">
      <h1>
        Currently studying at <span>Ngee Ann Polytechnic</span> , <br />
        pursuing a
        <span>Diploma in Information Technology</span>
      </h1>
      <p>
        As someone who has always been interested in how the internet is so
        powerful and has positively impacted human lives, I knew pursuing a
        Diploma in Information Technology was the ideal course for me. <br />
        <br />
        Since young, I have always been interested in how websites, phones, and
        literally anything under the umbrella of IT, worked. I have also had a
        soft spot for anything related to Forensic Science too, from reading
        forensic science journals and encyclopedias to religiously watching CSI
        every weekend. <br />
        <br />
        â€‹I aspire to pursue a Degree in Computer Science, as well as a Masters
        in Forensic Science, at NUS upon graduating from Ngee Ann Polytechnic.
      </p>
