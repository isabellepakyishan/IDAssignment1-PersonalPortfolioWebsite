            As a Year 1 freshman, students get to learn a wide-range of modules
            across the School of ICT. Modules covered include computing
            mathematics, cybersecurity fundamentals, design principles, data
            science fundamentals, fundamentals of IT professionals, programming.
            The Innovation made Possible module brings students across different
            schools and courses together to enable students to get to know peers
            outside of their course. ​ I have also joined special interest
            groups under the School of ICT, such as Overflow (Programming),
            Nullsec (Cybersecurity) and Photography and Videography.

            During the course of my study at PLMGSS, I joined the Handbells and
            Handchimes Ensemble. I represented the school in the Singapore Youth
            Festival (SYF) and the ensemble was awarded with a Certificate of
            Distinction. ​ I have participated in numerous community service
            projects as well. In 2019, right before COVID-19 emerged, my
            classmates and I volunteered at Assisi Hospice and befriended the
            elderly people at the hospice. That experience, to me, was a great
            eye-opener and also made me step back and look at things from the
            perspective of the elderly folks when I was interacting with them. I
            also cherished the time I was able to spend with my grandma more
            too!! ​<br />

            Over the 6 years that I studied in OLGC, my family and I have helped
            to raise funds during the school's fundraising day, also known as
            Family Fun Day. Every year, the money that we raise during the
            Family Fun Day would be completely given back to the school and we
            never defrayed the cost of our materials. ​ In addition, in 2013, I
            was asked to perform on the piano for the Prelude of the Awards Day
            Ceremony.
